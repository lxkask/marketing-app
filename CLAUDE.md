## Project Overview

This is a static HTML study guide ("tahák") for a marketing course, containing exported lecture notes and study materials. The content appears to be from a Czech university's INSIS system.

## Structure

- `insis-tahak/index.htm` - Main HTML file containing marketing course content (exported from Microsoft Word, ~1.1MB)
- `insis-tahak/style.css` - Custom styling for question/answer format display
- `insis-tahak/css.css` - Lato font definition
- `insis-tahak/marketing (2).pdf` - PDF version of marketing materials
- `insis-tahak/Poděl-marketing_files/` - Supporting images

## Notes

- The HTML file uses Windows-1250 encoding (Czech)
- No build process, package manager, or test suite exists
- This is purely static content - simply open `index.htm` in a browser to view
